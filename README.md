# example-client-autocomplete-sevice
An example client for the autocomplete service / API I built (see here: https://github.com/HugoJohnsson/autocomplete-service)

**Description**

I've used webpack to setup a simple development environment with TypeScript.
Project includes an autocompleted search box with associated code located in a
reusable class called "AutoCompletedSearchBox".
